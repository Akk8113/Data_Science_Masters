Why Use the Exception Class When Creating a Custom Exception?\n","The Exception class in Python serves as the base class for all built-in exceptions. When creating a custom exception, inheriting from the Exception class is important for several reasons:\n","\n","Consistency: Inheriting from Exception ensures that the custom exception behaves like other exceptions in Python, making it consistent with the language's exception handling mechanism.\n","\n","Exception Handling: By inheriting from Exception, the custom exception can be caught using generic exception handling code, such as except Exception as e, which is useful for catching unexpected errors.\n","\n","Functionality: The Exception class provides standard methods and properties, such as __str__() and args, which can be useful for customizing the error message or storing additional information about the error.\n","\n","Documentation and Readability: Using the Exception class clearly indicates that the class represents an error condition, improving the readability and maintainability of the code.\n","\n","Q2. Python Exception Hierarchy\n","Here's a Python program to print the exception hierarchy:\n","\n","python\n","Copy code\n","import inspect\n","\n","def print_exception_hierarchy(cls, indent=0):\n","    print(' ' * indent + cls.__name__)\n","    for subclass in cls.__subclasses__():\n","        print_exception_hierarchy(subclass, indent + 2)\n","\n","print_exception_hierarchy(BaseException)\n","This program recursively prints the hierarchy of exceptions, starting from the BaseException class.\n","\n","Q3. Errors Defined in the ArithmeticError Class\n","The ArithmeticError class is the base class for all errors that occur during arithmetic operations. It includes several specific errors:\n","\n","ZeroDivisionError: Raised when attempting to divide by zero.\n","\n","Example:\n","\n","python\n","Copy code\n","try:\n","    result = 10 / 0\n","except ZeroDivisionError as e:\n","    print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n","OverflowError: Raised when the result of an arithmetic operation exceeds the limits of the data type.\n","\n","Example:\n","\n","python\n","Copy code\n","import math\n","try:\n","    result = math.exp(1000)\n","except OverflowError as e:\n","    print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n","Q4. LookupError Class\n","The LookupError class is the base class for errors raised when a lookup on a collection or mapping fails. It includes specific errors like KeyError and IndexError.\n","\n","KeyError: Raised when a dictionary key is not found.\n","\n","Example:\n","\n","python\n","Copy code\n","data = {\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 30}\n","try:\n","    value = data[\"address\"]\n","except KeyError as e:\n","    print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n","IndexError: Raised when an index is out of range for a sequence.\n","\n","Example:\n","\n","python\n","Copy code\n","lst = [1, 2, 3]\n","try:\n","    value = lst[5]\n","except IndexError as e:\n","    print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n","Q5. ImportError and ModuleNotFoundError\n","ImportError:\n","ImportError is raised when an import statement fails to find the module or a name within the module.\n","\n","Example:\n","\n","python\n","Copy code\n","try:\n","    from math import non_existing_function\n","except ImportError as e:\n","    print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n","ModuleNotFoundError:\n","ModuleNotFoundError is a subclass of ImportError introduced in Python 3.6. It specifically indicates that the module itself could not be found, rather than an attribute within the module.\n","\n","Example:\n","\n","python\n","Copy code\n","try:\n","    import non_existing_module\n","except ModuleNotFoundError as e:\n","    print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n","Q6. Best Practices for Exception Handling in Python\n","Catch Specific Exceptions: Avoid using a bare except: clause, as it catches all exceptions. Instead, catch specific exceptions to make the code more readable and maintainable.\n","\n","python\n","Copy code\n","try:\n","    # Some operation\n","except ZeroDivisionError:\n","    # Handle division by zero\n","except ValueError:\n","    # Handle invalid value\n","Use finally for Cleanup: Use the finally block to release resources, such as closing files or network connections, regardless of whether an exception was raised.\n","\n","python\n","Copy code\n","file = open(\"example.txt\", \"r\")\n","try:\n","    # Work with the file\n","finally:\n","    file.close()\n","Avoid Swallowing Exceptions: Do not use a bare except clause without any handling logic, as this can make debugging difficult.\n","\n","python\n","Copy code\n","try:\n","    # Some operation\n","except Exception as e:\n","    print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n","Log Exceptions: Use logging to record exceptions and their context, which can be helpful for debugging and monitoring.\n","\n","python\n","Copy code\n","import logging\n","try:\n","    # Some operation\n","except Exception as e:\n","    logging.error(\"An error occurred\", exc_info=True)\n","Use Custom Exceptions: Define custom exceptions for specific error conditions, which can make the code more readable and the error handling more precise.\n","\n","python\n","Copy code\n","class CustomError(Exception):\n","    pass\n","\n","try:\n","    # Some operation\n","    raise CustomError(\"Something went wrong\")\n","except CustomError as e:\n","    print(f\"Custom error: {e}\")\n","Avoid Using Exceptions for Control Flow: Exceptions should be used for exceptional situations, not for regular control flow.\n","\n","Document Exception Handling: Clearly document the exceptions a function can raise and how they are handled, either in code comments or docstrings.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"Z5cPqzY4Jf3J"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"Baz0xcGEJgyy"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
