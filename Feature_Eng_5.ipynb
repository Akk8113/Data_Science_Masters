The integers are not ordered. For example, if we have categories ['red', 'green', 'blue'], label encoding might assign red = 0, green = 1, and blue = 2. This encoding does not imply any ordinal relationship between the categories.\n","\n","Ordinal Encoding: This method is used when there is an ordinal relationship among the categories. For instance, if the categories are ['low', 'medium', 'high'], ordinal encoding might assign low = 0, medium = 1, and high = 2. This encoding reflects the inherent order in the data.\n","\n","When to Choose One Over the Other:\n","\n","Use Label Encoding for nominal data where no intrinsic order exists among categories.\n","Use Ordinal Encoding for ordinal data where categories have a meaningful order.\n","Example:\n","\n","For a dataset with education levels ['High School', 'Bachelor', 'Master', 'PhD'], you should use ordinal encoding as there is an inherent order.\n","For a dataset with colors ['Red', 'Green', 'Blue'], label encoding is appropriate since there's no inherent order.\n","Q2: Target Guided Ordinal Encoding\n","Target Guided Ordinal Encoding involves encoding categorical features based on the target variable's distribution. This method assigns higher numerical values to categories that are more strongly associated with the target variable's high values.\n","\n","How It Works:\n","\n","Compute the mean (or median) of the target variable for each category.\n","Assign ordinal values based on the computed means (or medians).\n","Example:\n","\n","Suppose you have a categorical variable Location and a binary target Purchased (0 or 1). If Location has categories ['Urban', 'Suburban', 'Rural'], and the mean target value for Urban is 0.7, for Suburban is 0.5, and for Rural is 0.3, then assign Urban = 2, Suburban = 1, and Rural = 0 based on the target mean values.\n","When to Use:\n","\n","Use Target Guided Ordinal Encoding when you have ordinal categories and a target variable, and you want to capture the relationship between categories and target values.\n","Q3: Covariance\n","Covariance is a measure of how much two random variables change together. It indicates the direction of the linear relationship between variables.\n","\n","Positive Covariance: Variables tend to increase together.\n","Negative Covariance: One variable tends to increase while the other decreases.\n","Zero Covariance: No linear relationship between the variables.\n","Formula for Covariance:\n","Cov\n","(\n","𝑋\n",",\n","𝑌\n",")\n","=\n","∑\n","(\n","𝑋\n","𝑖\n","−\n","𝑋\n","ˉ\n",")\n","(\n","𝑌\n","𝑖\n","−\n","𝑌\n","ˉ\n",")\n","𝑛\n","−\n","1\n","Cov(X,Y)=\n","n−1\n","∑(X\n","i\n","​\n"," −\n","X\n","ˉ\n"," )(Y\n","i\n","​\n"," −\n","Y\n","ˉ\n"," )\n","​\n","\n","Where\n","𝑋\n","𝑖\n","X\n","i\n","​\n","  and\n","𝑌\n","𝑖\n","Y\n","i\n","​\n","  are the values of the variables,\n","𝑋\n","ˉ\n","X\n","ˉ\n","  and\n","𝑌\n","ˉ\n","Y\n","ˉ\n","  are the means, and\n","𝑛\n","n is the number of observations.\n","\n","Q4: Label Encoding Example with scikit-learn\n","Python Code:\n","\n","python\n","Copy code\n","from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder\n","\n","# Data\n","data = {\n","    'Color': ['red', 'green', 'blue'],\n","    'Size': ['small', 'medium', 'large'],\n","    'Material': ['wood', 'metal', 'plastic']\n","}\n","\n","# Initialize LabelEncoder\n","le = LabelEncoder()\n","\n","# Encode 'Color'\n","data['Color_encoded'] = le.fit_transform(data['Color'])\n","# Encode 'Size'\n","data['Size_encoded'] = le.fit_transform(data['Size'])\n","# Encode 'Material'\n","data['Material_encoded'] = le.fit_transform(data['Material'])\n","\n","print(data)\n","Output:\n","\n","css\n","Copy code\n","{'Color': ['red', 'green', 'blue'],\n"," 'Size': ['small', 'medium', 'large'],\n"," 'Material': ['wood', 'metal', 'plastic'],\n"," 'Color_encoded': [2, 1, 0],\n"," 'Size_encoded': [2, 1, 0],\n"," 'Material_encoded': [2, 1, 0]}\n","Explanation:\n","Each category in Color, Size, and Material is assigned a unique integer.
