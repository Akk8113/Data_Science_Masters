What is Matplotlib? Why is it used? Name Five Plots Using Pyplot\n","Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. It is widely used for data visualization and graphical plotting in the data analysis community. The library's most popular module, Pyplot, offers a collection of functions that make plotting simple and intuitive.\n","\n","Matplotlib is used for:\n","\n","Visualizing data to understand trends and patterns.\n","Creating publication-quality plots.\n","Customizing plots to fit specific needs.\n","Five types of plots that can be created using the Pyplot module are:\n","\n","Line Plot\n","Scatter Plot\n","Bar Plot\n","Histogram\n","Pie Chart\n","Q2. What is a Scatter Plot?\n","A scatter plot is a type of plot that shows the relationship between two variables using dots, where each dot represents an observation. It helps to identify correlations or patterns between the variables.\n","\n","Here's the code to generate and plot the data:\n","\n","python\n","Copy code\n","import numpy as np\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","\n","np.random.seed(3)\n","\n","x = 3 + np.random.normal(0, 2, 50)\n","y = 3 + np.random.normal(0, 2, len(x))\n","\n","plt.scatter(x, y)\n","plt.title(\"Scatter Plot Example\")\n","plt.xlabel(\"X-axis\")\n","plt.ylabel(\"Y-axis\")\n","plt.show()\n","Q3. Why is the subplot() Function Used? Four Line Plots Using subplot()\n","The subplot() function in Matplotlib is used to create multiple plots in a single figure. It allows you to organize your plots in a grid, making it easier to compare different plots side-by-side.\n","\n","Here's the code to create four line plots using subplot():\n","\n","python\n","Copy code\n","import numpy as np\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","\n","# Data for four line plots\n","x = np.array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\n","\n","y1 = np.array([0, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500])\n","y2 = np.array([50, 20, 40, 20, 60, 70])\n","y3 = np.array([10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60])\n","y4 = np.array([200, 350, 250, 550, 450, 150])\n","\n","# Plotting\n","plt.subplot(2, 2, 1)\n","plt.plot(x, y1)\n","plt.title(\"Line 1\")\n","\n","plt.subplot(2, 2, 2)\n","plt.plot(x, y2)\n","plt.title(\"Line 2\")\n","\n","plt.subplot(2, 2, 3)\n","plt.plot(x, y3)\n","plt.title(\"Line 3\")\n","\n","plt.subplot(2, 2, 4)\n","plt.plot(x, y4)\n","plt.title(\"Line 4\")\n","\n","plt.tight_layout()\n","plt.show()\n","Q4. What is a Bar Plot? Plot a Bar and Horizontal Bar Plot\n","A bar plot is a type of plot that presents categorical data with rectangular bars, where the length of each bar represents the value of the category. It is used to compare different categories or to show changes over time.\n","\n","Here's the code for a bar plot and a horizontal bar plot:\n","\n","python\n","Copy code\n","import numpy as np\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","\n","company = np.array([\"Apple\", \"Microsoft\", \"Google\", \"AMD\"])\n","profit = np.array([3000, 8000, 1000, 10000])\n","\n","# Vertical Bar Plot\n","plt.bar(company, profit)\n","plt.title(\"Company Profits - Bar Plot\")\n","plt.xlabel(\"Company\")\n","plt.ylabel(\"Profit\")\n","plt.show()\n","\n","# Horizontal Bar Plot\n","plt.barh(company, profit)\n","plt.title(\"Company Profits - Horizontal Bar Plot\")\n","plt.xlabel(\"Profit\")\n","plt.ylabel(\"Company\")\n","plt.show()\n","Q5. What is a Box Plot? Plot a Box Plot\n","A box plot (also known as a whisker plot) is a graphical representation of the distribution of data based on a five-number summary: minimum, first quartile (Q1), median, third quartile (Q3), and maximum. It helps to identify outliers and understand the data distribution's spread and skewness.\n","\n","Here's the code to plot a box plot:\n","\n","python\n","Copy code\n","import numpy as np\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","\n","box1 = np.random.normal(100, 10, 200)\n","box2 = np.random.normal(90, 20, 200)\n","\n","plt.boxplot([box1, box2], labels=[\"Box 1\", \"Box 2\"])\n","plt.title(\"Box Plot Example\")\n","plt.ylabel(\"Values\")\n","plt.show()\n","These examples cover the basic concepts and provide sample implementations using Matplotlib. You can customize the plots further as per your requirements."],"metadata":{"id":"k38e6uyBwUIN"}}]}
