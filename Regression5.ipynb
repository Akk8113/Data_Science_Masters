What is Lasso Regression, and how does it differ from other regression techniques?\n","Lasso Regression, short for \"Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator,\" is a type of linear regression that uses regularization to improve the model's performance. The regularization term is the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients, multiplied by a parameter λ (lambda). This term penalizes large coefficients and can shrink some of them to zero, effectively performing feature selection.\n","\n","Lasso Regression differs from other regression techniques like Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and Ridge Regression. OLS aims to minimize the sum of squared residuals without any regularization, leading to potential overfitting if the model has many features. Ridge Regression, on the other hand, uses L2 regularization (sum of squared coefficients) instead of L1 regularization. While Ridge Regression can shrink coefficients, it typically does not set them exactly to zero, so it doesn't perform feature selection as Lasso does.\n","\n","Q2. What is the main advantage of using Lasso Regression in feature selection?\n","The main advantage of Lasso Regression in feature selection is its ability to shrink some coefficients to zero, effectively excluding irrelevant features from the model. This helps in simplifying the model and improving its interpretability and performance, especially when dealing with high-dimensional datasets where the number of features is large compared to the number of observations.\n","\n","Q3. How do you interpret the coefficients of a Lasso Regression model?\n","In Lasso Regression, the coefficients represent the change in the response variable for a one-unit change in the corresponding predictor variable, while holding other variables constant. However, due to the L1 regularization, some coefficients may be exactly zero, indicating that the corresponding predictor has been excluded from the model. The non-zero coefficients represent the selected features that have a significant impact on the response variable.\n","\n","Q4. What are the tuning parameters that can be adjusted in Lasso Regression, and how do they affect the model's performance?\n","The primary tuning parameter in Lasso Regression is the regularization parameter λ (lambda). This parameter controls the strength of the penalty applied to the coefficients:\n","\n","High λ: Stronger regularization, leading to more coefficients being shrunk towards zero. This can result in a simpler model with fewer features, reducing variance but possibly increasing bias (underfitting).\n","Low λ: Weaker regularization, leading to less shrinkage of the coefficients. This can result in a more complex model with more features, reducing bias but possibly increasing variance (overfitting).\n","Selecting the optimal λ value is crucial for balancing the bias-variance trade-off and improving the model's performance.\n","\n","Q5. Can Lasso Regression be used for non-linear regression problems? If yes, how?\n","Lasso Regression is inherently a linear model, but it can be extended to handle non-linear relationships by transforming the input features. This can be done by using techniques such as polynomial feature expansion, interaction terms, or basis functions. By transforming the input features into a higher-dimensional space, Lasso Regression can then be applied to capture non-linear relationships between the input features and the target variable.\n","\n","Q6. What is the difference between Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression?\n","The key difference between Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression lies in the type of regularization used:\n","\n","Ridge Regression: Uses L2 regularization, which penalizes the sum of the squared coefficients. This technique shrinks the coefficients but usually does not set any of them to exactly zero, meaning all features are included in the model.\n","Lasso Regression: Uses L1 regularization, which penalizes the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients. This penalty can shrink some coefficients to zero, effectively performing feature selection by excluding certain features from the model.\n","Lasso is preferred when feature selection is desired, while Ridge is used when all features are believed to contribute to the outcome.\n","\n","Q7. Can Lasso Regression handle multicollinearity in the input features? If yes, how?\n","Yes, Lasso Regression can handle multicollinearity to some extent. Multicollinearity occurs when two or more predictor variables are highly correlated. In the presence of multicollinearity, Lasso may select one of the correlated predictors and set the coefficients of others to zero, thereby effectively excluding redundant features. This feature selection capability helps in reducing the variance and improving the interpretability of the model.\n","\n","Q8. How do you choose the optimal value of the regularization parameter (lambda) in Lasso Regression?\n","The optimal value of λ (lambda) can be chosen using cross-validation techniques, such as:\n","\n","k-Fold Cross-Validation: The dataset is split into k subsets (folds). The model is trained on k-1 folds and tested on the remaining fold. This process is repeated k times, each time with a different fold as the test set. The average error across all folds is calculated for different λ values, and the λ with the lowest error is chosen.\n","Grid Search: A range of λ values is defined, and the model is trained and evaluated for each value. The λ that yields the best cross-validation performance is selected.\n","Regularization Path Methods: Techniques like Least Angle Regression (LARS) can be used to compute the solution path as a function of λ, allowing for an efficient search for the optimal λ.\n","The goal is to select the λ that minimizes the cross-validated error, balancing the model's complexity and performance."],"metadata":{"id":"QbF32lmrYiZ8"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"OPkstHcVY1u3"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
