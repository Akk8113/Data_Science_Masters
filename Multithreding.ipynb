Multithreading in Python\n","Multithreading is a concurrent execution model in Python that allows multiple threads to run simultaneously within a single process. Each thread runs independently but shares the same memory space, which allows for data sharing and communication between threads. Multithreading is often used to improve the performance of applications that have to perform many concurrent tasks, such as network servers, or to make programs more responsive, like in user interfaces.\n","\n","Why is Multithreading Used?\n","\n","Concurrency: To perform multiple operations at the same time, such as handling multiple client requests in a web server.\n","Responsiveness: To keep an application responsive by handling tasks like I/O operations in the background.\n","Resource Sharing: Threads share the same memory space, which allows for efficient communication and data sharing.\n","Module Used for Multithreading in Python:\n","The module used to handle threads in Python is called threading.\n","\n","Q2. Why Use the threading Module?\n","The threading module is used in Python to create and manage threads. It provides a higher-level and more convenient interface compared to the low-level _thread module. Some of the important functions provided by the threading module include:\n","\n","activeCount(): Returns the number of Thread objects currently alive.\n","currentThread(): Returns the Thread object corresponding to the caller's thread of control.\n","enumerate(): Returns a list of all Thread objects currently alive.\n","Example:\n","\n","python\n","Copy code\n","import threading\n","\n","def print_numbers():\n","    for i in range(5):\n","        print(i)\n","\n","# Create a new thread\n","t = threading.Thread(target=print_numbers)\n","t.start()\n","\n","# Get the number of active threads\n","print(f\"Active threads: {threading.activeCount()}\")\n","\n","# Get the current thread\n","print(f\"Current thread: {threading.currentThread()}\")\n","\n","# List all active threads\n","print(f\"Enumerate threads: {threading.enumerate()}\")\n","Q3. Explanation of Threading Functions\n","run(): This method represents the thread's activity. It is the entry point for a thread and is typically overridden in a subclass to define the thread's behavior. However, it is not called directly, but through the start() method.\n","start(): This method starts the thread's activity by calling the run() method in a separate thread of control. Once started, the thread's activity can begin independently of the main program.\n","join(): This method blocks the calling thread until the thread whose join() method is called is terminated. It is used to wait for threads to complete before proceeding.\n","isAlive(): This method returns a boolean indicating whether the thread is still running.\n","Example:\n","\n","python\n","Copy code\n","import threading\n","import time\n","\n","class MyThread(threading.Thread):\n","    def run(self):\n","        print(f\"Thread {self.name} is starting.\")\n","        time.sleep(2)\n","        print(f\"Thread {self.name} is ending.\")\n","\n","t1 = MyThread()\n","t2 = MyThread()\n","\n","t1.start()\n","t2.start()\n","\n","t1.join()\n","t2.join()\n","\n","print(f\"Thread t1 is alive: {t1.isAlive()}\")\n","print(f\"Thread t2 is alive: {t2.isAlive()}\")\n","Q4. Python Program to Create Two Threads\n","python\n","Copy code\n","import threading\n","\n","def print_squares():\n","    for i in range(1, 6):\n","        print(f\"Square of {i} is {i**2}\")\n","\n","def print_cubes():\n","    for i in range(1, 6):\n","        print(f\"Cube of {i} is {i**3}\")\n","\n","thread1 = threading.Thread(target=print_squares)\n","thread2 = threading.Thread(target=print_cubes)\n","\n","thread1.start()\n","thread2.start()\n","\n","thread1.join()\n","thread2.join()\n","\n","print(\"Both threads have completed.\")\n","Q5. Advantages and Disadvantages of Multithreading\n","Advantages:\n","\n","Concurrency: Allows multiple tasks to be performed simultaneously.\n","Improved Performance: Can improve the performance of I/O-bound and high-latency tasks.\n","Resource Sharing: Threads can share memory and resources more easily than separate processes.\n","Disadvantages:\n","\n","Complexity: Writing thread-safe code can be complex and error-prone.\n","Overhead: Threads require resources and can cause overhead, particularly if not managed properly.\n","Global Interpreter Lock (GIL): In Python, the GIL can limit the performance gains from multithreading, especially for CPU-bound tasks.\n","Q6. Deadlocks and Race Conditions\n","Deadlocks:\n","A deadlock occurs when two or more threads are blocked forever, waiting for each other to release resources. This situation can happen if two threads hold locks and each thread needs the lock held by the other to continue.\n","\n","Example:\n","\n","python\n","Copy code\n","import threading\n","\n","lock1 = threading.Lock()\n","lock2 = threading.Lock()\n","\n","def thread1():\n","    lock1.acquire()\n","    print(\"Thread 1 acquired lock1\")\n","    lock2.acquire()\n","    print(\"Thread 1 acquired lock2\")\n","    lock1.release()\n","    lock2.release()\n","\n","def thread2():\n","    lock2.acquire()\n","    print(\"Thread 2 acquired lock2\")\n","    lock1.acquire()\n","    print(\"Thread 2 acquired lock1\")\n","    lock2.release()\n","    lock1.release()\n","\n","t1 = threading.Thread(target=thread1)\n","t2 = threading.Thread(target=thread2)\n","\n","t1.start()\n","t2.start()\n","\n","t1.join()\n","t2.join()\n","In this example, if thread1 acquires lock1 and waits for lock2, and thread2 acquires lock2 and waits for lock1, a deadlock occurs.\n","\n","Race Conditions:\n","A race condition occurs when two or more threads can access shared data and they try to change it at the same time. The outcome depends on the timing of the threads, making the program's behavior unpredictable.\n","\n","Example:\n","\n","python\n","Copy code\n","import threading\n","\n","counter = 0\n","\n","def increment():\n","    global counter\n","    for _ in range(100000):\n","        counter += 1\n","\n","t1 = threading.Thread(target=increment)\n","t2 = threading.Thread(target=increment)\n","\n","t1.start()\n","t2.start()\n","\n","t1.join()\n","t2.join()\n","\n","print(counter)  # The output may vary each time due to race condition.\n","In this example, both threads are incrementing the counter variable, but without proper synchronization, the final value of counter can be inconsistent due to race conditions."],"metadata":{"id":"sZGpwiZuKX5T"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"WJK51lCGKYvO"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
