    "A database is a collection of data that is organized and stored electronically in a computer system. It is a software application that manages data storage, retrieval, and manipulation. Different types of databases exist, including SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL (Not Only SQL) databases.\n",

    "SQL databases are organized in tables with rows and columns, and data is stored in a structured format. SQL databases are designed to handle complex queries and transactions, and are commonly used in enterprise applications. Examples of SQL databases include MySQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server.\n",

    "NoSQL databases, on the other hand, are designed to handle unstructured or semi-structured data, such as JSON or XML documents. NoSQL databases are often used in web applications, mobile applications, and big data analytics. Examples of NoSQL databases include MongoDB, Cassandra, and Couchbase.\n",
