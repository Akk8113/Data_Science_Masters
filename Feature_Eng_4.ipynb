This transformation is crucial because most algorithms require numerical inputs to perform calculations and model fitting. Data encoding helps to make categorical data suitable for analysis, ensuring that algorithms can leverage the information effectively.\n","\n","Q2: What is Nominal Encoding?\n","Nominal encoding, also known as label encoding, assigns a unique integer to each category of a categorical variable. This method is useful for categorical variables where the values do not have any inherent order or rank.\n","\n","Example: Suppose you have a dataset with a column \"Color\" containing the values [\"Red\", \"Blue\", \"Green\"]. Using nominal encoding, you might convert these values to:\n","\n","Red → 0\n","Blue → 1\n","Green → 2\n","In a real-world scenario, if you have a categorical variable \"Brand\" with categories like [\"Nike\", \"Adidas\", \"Puma\"], nominal encoding would convert these to integers (e.g., Nike → 0, Adidas → 1, Puma → 2).\n","\n","Q3: When is Nominal Encoding Preferred over One-Hot Encoding?\n","Nominal encoding is preferred over one-hot encoding when the categorical variable has a large number of unique values and does not carry ordinal information. It is also useful when the encoding needs to be computationally efficient and when there is no meaningful distance between categories.\n","\n","Practical Example: For a feature like \"Product ID\" in a retail dataset, where each product has a unique ID, nominal encoding is more efficient than one-hot encoding because one-hot encoding would result in a vast number of columns if there are many unique IDs.\n","\n","Q4: Encoding Technique for a Categorical Column with 5 Unique Values\n","For a categorical column with 5 unique values, you could use nominal encoding if the variable does not have a meaningful order. This will create a single new column with integer values.\n","\n","Choice: Nominal encoding is suitable here because one-hot encoding would create 5 new columns, which might be less efficient and unnecessary if the categorical feature does not have ordinal meaning.\n","\n","Explanation: Suppose your categorical column is \"Fruit\" with values [\"Apple\", \"Banana\", \"Cherry\", \"Date\", \"Elderberry\"]. Using nominal encoding, you’d map these to:\n","\n","Apple → 0\n","Banana → 1\n","Cherry → 2\n","Date → 3\n","Elderberry → 4\n","Q5: New Columns Created Using Nominal Encoding\n","If you have a categorical column with 2 unique values and use nominal encoding, you'll create 1 new column.\n","\n","Calculation: For a categorical column with 5 unique values:\n","\n","Number of new columns: 1 (since nominal encoding creates one column where each category is represented by an integer).\n","Q6: Encoding Technique for a Dataset of Animals\n","For a dataset with categorical data such as species, habitat, and diet, one-hot encoding is typically preferred. This method is suitable because categorical features may not have any inherent ordinal relationship, and one-hot encoding prevents the algorithm from misinterpreting categorical values as ordinal or continuous.\n","\n","Justification: One-hot encoding will create binary columns for each category, ensuring that the model does not assume any ordinal relationships between categories.\n","\n","Q7: Encoding Technique for Customer Churn Dataset\n","For the dataset with features like \"gender,\" \"contract type,\" and \"tenure\":\n","\n","Gender: Use nominal encoding (e.g., Male → 0, Female → 1) if there is no ordinal relationship.\n","Contract Type: Use one-hot encoding to create binary columns for each type (e.g., Month-to-Month, One-Year, Two-Year).\n","Age, Monthly Charges, Tenure: These are numerical features and should not be encoded but scaled if needed.\n","Step-by-Step Implementation:\n","\n","Gender: Convert to numerical values (0 for Male, 1 for Female).\n","Contract Type: Apply one-hot encoding to create separate columns for each contract type.\n","Other numerical features: No encoding needed, but consider scaling for model efficiency."],"metadata":{"id":"0RYHNHzm1jTm"}}]}
