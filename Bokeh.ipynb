Examples of glyphs include lines, circles, rectangles, etc. You can add glyphs to a Bokeh plot using specific methods.\n","\n","Example: Adding circle glyphs to a plot:\n","\n","python\n","Copy code\n","from bokeh.plotting import figure, show\n","\n","# Create a new plot\n","p = figure(title=\"Bokeh Glyphs Example\")\n","\n","# Add circle glyphs\n","p.circle([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 2, 4, 7], size=15, color=\"navy\", alpha=0.5)\n","\n","# Show the plot\n","show(p)\n","Q3: Customizing Bokeh Plot Appearance\n","You can customize various aspects of a Bokeh plot, including the axes, title, legend, and more.\n","\n","Example:\n","\n","python\n","Copy code\n","from bokeh.plotting import figure, show\n","\n","# Create a new plot\n","p = figure(title=\"Customized Bokeh Plot\", x_axis_label='X-Axis', y_axis_label='Y-Axis')\n","\n","# Add a line renderer\n","p.line([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 2, 4, 7], legend_label=\"Temp.\", line_width=2, line_color=\"green\")\n","\n","# Customize title and axes\n","p.title.text_font_size = '16pt'\n","p.xaxis.axis_label_text_color = 'red'\n","p.yaxis.axis_label_text_font_size = '12pt'\n","p.xaxis.major_label_text_font_size = '10pt'\n","\n","# Customize the legend\n","p.legend.title = \"Legend\"\n","p.legend.label_text_font_size = '10pt'\n","p.legend.location = \"top_left\"\n","\n","# Show the plot\n","show(p)\n","Q4: Bokeh Server for Real-Time Interactive Plots\n","The Bokeh server allows for creating interactive web applications that can respond to user input and update plots in real-time.
