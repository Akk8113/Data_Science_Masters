What is Multiprocessing in Python?\n","Multiprocessing in Python involves using multiple processes, where each process has its own memory space. This allows parallel execution of code, enabling better utilization of multi-core CPUs. The multiprocessing module in Python provides a means to create and manage separate processes.\n","\n","Why is it Useful?\n","\n","Parallelism: Multiprocessing allows tasks to be run in parallel, which can significantly speed up CPU-bound tasks.\n","Separate Memory Space: Each process runs in its own memory space, making it safe from the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) that affects multithreading in CPython. This allows full utilization of multi-core CPUs.\n","Q2. Differences Between Multiprocessing and Multithreading\n","Memory Sharing:\n","\n","Multiprocessing: Each process has its own memory space. They do not share memory, making inter-process communication more complex but safe from memory corruption issues.\n","Multithreading: Threads share the same memory space within a process, which can lead to issues like race conditions but allows easy communication between threads.\n","Concurrency:\n","\n","Multiprocessing: Provides true parallelism by utilizing multiple cores of a CPU. Ideal for CPU-bound tasks.\n","Multithreading: Limited by the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in CPython, which prevents multiple native threads from executing Python bytecode simultaneously. More suitable for I/O-bound tasks.\n","Overhead:\n","\n","Multiprocessing: Higher overhead due to the creation of separate memory spaces for each process.\n","Multithreading: Lower overhead as threads share the same memory space.\n","Q3. Creating a Process Using the Multiprocessing Module\n","Here's a simple example of creating a process in Python using the multiprocessing module:\n","\n","python\n","Copy code\n","import multiprocessing\n","\n","def print_number(number):\n","    print(f\"Number: {number}\")\n","\n","if __name__ == '__main__':\n","    process = multiprocessing.Process(target=print_number, args=(5,))\n","    process.start()\n","    process.join()\n","In this example, a new process is created to run the print_number function.\n","\n","Q4. What is a Multiprocessing Pool in Python?\n","A multiprocessing pool in Python is a collection of worker processes that can execute tasks concurrently. The multiprocessing.Pool class provides a convenient way to parallelize the execution of a function across multiple input values, distributing the input data across processes.\n","\n","Why is it Used?\n","\n","To manage multiple worker processes efficiently.\n","To parallelize tasks, making it easier to distribute workload among multiple processes.\n","Q5. Creating a Pool of Worker Processes\n","Here's an example of creating a pool of worker processes using the multiprocessing module:\n","\n","python\n","Copy code\n","import multiprocessing\n","\n","def square(x):\n","    return x * x\n","\n","if __name__ == '__main__':\n","    pool = multiprocessing.Pool(processes=4)  # Create a pool with 4 worker processes\n","    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n","    result = pool.map(square, numbers)\n","    print(result)\n","    pool.close()\n","    pool.join()\n","In this example, the square function is executed concurrently by the worker processes in the pool for each number in the list.\n","\n","Q6. Creating 4 Processes to Print Different Numbers\n","Here's a Python program that creates four processes, each printing a different number:\n","\n","python\n","Copy code\n","import multiprocessing\n","\n","def print_number(number):\n","    print(f\"Process ID: {multiprocessing.current_process().pid} - Number: {number}\")\n","\n","if __name__ == '__main__':\n","    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n","    processes = []\n","\n","    for number in numbers:\n","        process = multiprocessing.Process(target=print_number, args=(number,))\n","        processes.append(process)\n","        process.start()\n","\n","    for process in processes:\n","        process.join()\n","In this program, each process prints a unique number. The processes are created and started in a loop, and join() is called to ensure that the main process waits for all child processes to complete.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"kZtRlr4kK9pS"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"K5nP8IR5K-TY"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
