Dividing a Number by 3 Until Less Than or Equal to 10\n","To find how many times a given number can be divided by 3 before it is less than or equal to 10, you can use a while loop. Here's an example:\n","\n","python\n","Copy code\n","number = 100  # You can replace 100 with any number\n","count = 0\n","\n","while number > 10:\n","    number /= 3\n","    count += 1\n","\n","print(f\"The number can be divided {count} times before it becomes less than or equal to 10.\")\n","In this example, number starts at 100 and is divided by 3 in each iteration of the loop. The loop continues until number is less than or equal to 10. The variable count keeps track of how many times the division occurred.\n","\n","2. Why and When to Use while Loop in Python\n","Why Use while Loop:\n","\n","The while loop is useful when the number of iterations is not known beforehand and depends on a condition being met. It is often used when you need to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a certain condition remains true.\n","When to Use while Loop:\n","\n","Use a while loop when you have a condition that needs to be checked before each iteration, and you don't know in advance how many times you want to loop.\n","Example:\n","\n","python\n","Copy code\n","counter = 0\n","limit = 5\n","\n","while counter < limit:\n","    print(f\"Counter: {counter}\")\n","    counter += 1\n","In this example, the loop prints the value of counter and increments it by 1 in each iteration. The loop continues until counter is no longer less than limit.\n","\n","3. Use Nested while Loop to Print 3 Different Patterns\n","Pattern 1: Right-Angle Triangle\n","\n","python\n","Copy code\n","n = 5\n","i = 1\n","\n","while i <= n:\n","    j = 1\n","    while j <= i:\n","        print(\"*\", end=\" \")\n","        j += 1\n","    print()\n","    i += 1\n","Pattern 2: Inverted Right-Angle Triangle\n","\n","python\n","Copy code\n","n = 5\n","i = n\n","\n","while i > 0:\n","    j = 1\n","    while j <= i:\n","        print(\"*\", end=\" \")\n","        j += 1\n","    print()\n","    i -= 1\n","Pattern 3: Pyramid\n","\n","python\n","Copy code\n","n = 5\n","i = 1\n","\n","while i <= n:\n","    spaces = n - i\n","    while spaces > 0:\n","        print(\" \", end=\" \")\n","        spaces -= 1\n","    stars = 1\n","    while stars <= (2 * i - 1):\n","        print(\"*\", end=\" \")\n","        stars += 1\n","    print()\n","    i += 1\n","4 & 5. Reverse a while Loop to Display Numbers from 10 to 1\n","python\n","Copy code\n","number = 10\n","\n","while number >= 1:\n","    print(number)\n","    number -= 1\n","This loop starts at 10 and decrements the value of number by 1 in each iteration, printing the current value until number is less than 1."],"metadata":{"id":"ntzm4kGiDoiP"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"MWVV16dQFRjG"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
