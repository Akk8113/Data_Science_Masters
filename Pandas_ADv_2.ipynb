Difference Between loc and iloc in pandas.DataFrame\n","loc: Accesses rows and columns by label/index names. It includes the last element in the range.\n","iloc: Accesses rows and columns by integer-location based indexing. It does not include the last element in the range.\n","Q3. Reindexing and Accessing Rows\n","python\n","Copy code\n","reindex = [3, 0, 1, 2]\n","new_df = df.reindex(reindex)\n","\n","# Output for new_df.loc[2]\n","print(new_df.loc[2])\n","\n","# Output for new_df.iloc[2]\n","print(new_df.iloc[2])\n","Observation:\n","new_df.loc[2] uses the label-based indexing and will return the row with the original index label 2.\n","new_df.iloc[2] uses integer-based indexing and will return the third row in the reindexed DataFrame, which corresponds to the original index 1.\n","Q4.

Windows Function in Pandas\n","The windows function in pandas is used for performing operations over a sliding window of a specified width.
