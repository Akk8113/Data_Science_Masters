Explain non-relational databases in short. In which scenarios it is preferred to use MongoDB over SQL databases?\n","MongoDB is a popular, open-source, document-oriented NoSQL database designed for scalability and flexibility. It stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format called BSON (Binary JSON), allowing for rich data models and complex queries.\n","\n","Non-relational databases (NoSQL databases) are databases that do not use the traditional relational database structure, which typically involves tables with fixed columns and rows. Non-relational databases are designed to handle large amounts of unstructured or semi-structured data, offering flexibility in data storage, horizontal scalability, and high performance.\n","\n","Scenarios where MongoDB is preferred over SQL databases:\n","\n","Dynamic Schema: When the schema is not fixed or is frequently changing, MongoDB's flexible data model is advantageous.\n","High Volume of Data: MongoDB can efficiently handle large datasets with its distributed architecture.\n","Unstructured Data: When dealing with data that doesn't fit neatly into tables (e.g., documents, social media posts), MongoDB's document-oriented nature is useful.\n","Horizontal Scaling: MongoDB supports sharding, which allows for horizontal scaling across multiple servers, making it suitable for large-scale applications.\n","Complex Data Types: MongoDB can store complex data types like arrays and nested documents, making it ideal for applications requiring rich data structures.\n","Q2: State and Explain the features of MongoDB.\n","Document-Oriented Storage: MongoDB stores data in documents, which are similar to JSON objects, allowing for complex data structures with nested data and arrays.\n","Dynamic Schema: Unlike relational databases, MongoDB does not require a fixed schema, allowing fields to vary across documents.\n","Scalability: MongoDB supports horizontal scaling through sharding, distributing data across multiple servers.\n","High Availability: Built-in replication through replica sets ensures data availability and redundancy.\n","Indexing: Supports various types of indexing, including single field, compound, geospatial, and text indexes, to optimize query performance.\n","Aggregation Framework: Provides powerful tools for data analysis and transformation, including filtering, grouping, and sorting.\n","Rich Query Language: Supports a wide range of queries, including range queries, regular expression searches, and field-specific searches.\n","Flexibility: Can store various types of data, including structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data.\n","Q3: Write a code to connect MongoDB to Python. Also, create a database and a collection in MongoDB.\n","To connect MongoDB to Python, you'll need to use the pymongo library. Here's a simple code example:\n","\n","python\n","Copy code\n","from pymongo import MongoClient\n","\n","# Connect to MongoDB\n","client = MongoClient(\"mongodb://localhost:27017/\")\n","\n","# Create a database\n","db = client[\"example_db\"]\n","\n","# Create a collection\n","collection = db[\"example_collection\"]\n","\n","print(\"Database and collection created successfully.\")\n","Q4: Using the database and the collection created in question number 3, write a code to insert one record, and insert many records. Use the find() and find_one() methods to print the inserted record.\n","python\n","Copy code\n","# Insert one record\n","record = {\n","    \"name\": \"John Doe\",\n","    \"age\": 30,\n","    \"city\": \"New York\"\n","}\n","inserted_id = collection.insert_one(record).inserted_id\n","print(f\"Inserted record ID: {inserted_id}\")\n","\n","# Insert many records\n","records = [\n","    {\"name\": \"Jane Doe\", \"age\": 25, \"city\": \"Los Angeles\"},\n","    {\"name\": \"Alice Smith\", \"age\": 28, \"city\": \"Chicago\"},\n","    {\"name\": \"Bob Johnson\", \"age\": 35, \"city\": \"San Francisco\"}\n","]\n","collection.insert_many(records)\n","\n","# Find and print the inserted record\n","print(\"One record:\", collection.find_one({\"name\": \"John Doe\"}))\n","\n","# Find and print all inserted records\n","for doc in collection.find():\n","    print(doc)\n","Q5: Explain how you can use the find() method to query the MongoDB database. Write a simple code to demonstrate this.\n","The find() method in MongoDB is used to retrieve multiple documents from a collection based on a specified query. It returns a cursor object, which can be iterated to access the results.\n","\n","Example:\n","\n","python\n","Copy code\n","# Query for all documents where age is greater than 25\n","query = {\"age\": {\"$gt\": 25}}\n","results = collection.find(query)\n","\n","for document in results:\n","    print(document)\n","Q6: Explain the sort() method. Give an example to demonstrate sorting in MongoDB.\n","The sort() method in MongoDB is used to order the results of a query in either ascending (1) or descending (-1) order based on one or more fields.\n","\n","Example:\n","\n","python\n","Copy code\n","# Sort the results by age in descending order\n","sorted_results = collection.find().sort(\"age\", -1)\n","\n","for document in sorted_results:\n","    print(document)\n","Q7: Explain why delete_one(), delete_many(), and drop() are used.\n","delete_one(): This method deletes the first document that matches the query criteria. It's used when you need to remove a specific document from a collection.\n","\n","Example: collection.delete_one({\"name\": \"John Doe\"})\n","delete_many(): This method deletes all documents that match the query criteria. It's used when you want to remove multiple documents based on a condition.\n","\n","Example: collection.delete_many({\"age\": {\"$lt\": 30}})\n","drop(): This method deletes an entire collection from the database, including all documents and associated indexes. It's used when you want to completely remove a collection.\n","\n","Example: collection.drop()\n","These methods help in managing and maintaining the database by allowing for selective or complete deletion of dat"],"metadata":{"id":"lbtCTPkvLnLF"}}]}
